## web-worker
- to work with web worker in react, we either create the worker file in public folder
- or import worker file as a script, created as blob (Refer: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/web-worker-reactjs-2sswe?file=%2Fsrc%2Fworker.js)
- why we need to put the file in piblic folder (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74720070/why-the-web-workers-files-have-to-be-inside-my-public-folder-of-the-react-applic)
